      "text": "In anticipation of April Fools\u2019 Day, I\u2019ve been digging around the research collection\u2019s historical joke books, in search of a good joke. Pity the poor sod who goes searching for funny jokes inside a joke book, right? Well, historically speaking, I\u2019m not alone in this endeavor, and people have long sought to collect jokes and to find them, which is why NYPL owns hundreds of joke books that span basically the history of civilization.",

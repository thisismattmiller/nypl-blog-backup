      "text": "My kid is seven months old, which means we've survived the fourth and fifth trimesters of his life!

It's also easy to get sucked into wormholes of outdated advice, horror stories, and judgmental forums. Thankfully, there are also lots of great books that can guide the new parent through the daily joys and crises of these dizzying first months.",

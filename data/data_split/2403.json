      "text": "Eug\u00e8ne Atget took relatively few pictures of people. There is a series dating from about 1898 to 1900 of people in the small trades (petits m\u00e9tiers): the ragpicker, the organ grinder, ambulatory vendors of herbs, lampshades, plaster statues, baskets. And then there is a small series on prostitutes, from 1921.",

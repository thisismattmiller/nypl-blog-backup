But the most iconic Alice images remain John Tenniel\u2019s illustrations for the first edition published in 1865. This February marked the bicentennial anniversary of Tenniel\u2019s birth, and in celebration of that milestone, The New York Public Library has digitized a set of Alice books interleaved with proofs of Tenniel\u2019s illustrations.",

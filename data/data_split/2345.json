      "text": "The footage of Juana Vargas \"La Macarrona\" (1870-1947), filmed in 1917 by L\u00e9onide Massine and held in the Jerome Robbins Dance Division at the Library for the Performing Arts, is one of the Library's most important, and little-known, flamenco treasures. As a member of the Wertheim study, I was honored to be invited to write a blog post about the Library's significant holdings related to flamenco.",

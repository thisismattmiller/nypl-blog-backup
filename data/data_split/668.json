      "text": "One of the cool perks of being a librarian is that you sometimes get to read books before they come out. I had the opportunity (and immense pleasure) to get an electronic galley copy of Lamar Giles's debut novel Fake ID for just this reason. After loading the advance review copy on my nook, I have to admit... the story was hard to put it down. I found the story of \"Nick Pearson\" and his family on the run quite compelling. It left me with several follow up questions for the author, which we agreed to share with all of you.",
